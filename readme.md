# Team Reflect Assignment

## Introduction

We enjoyed the interview with you and would love to see some of your
skills in practise. The assignment is used to see if your a good match
for the team and the type of the work we do.

**Good luck!**

## Retrospective

This was a cool assignment, I did not have any experience yet with Stenciljs so this was a cool challenge.
I timeboxed it to 6 hours max and tried to see what I could create in that time.

Below I have some improvement points I see which can be made.

## Improvements

- Money Input can be made configurable for which values are allowed, this also applies to the validator
- Some code cleanup for the flags used in money-input
