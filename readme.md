# Team Reflect Assignment

## Introduction

We enjoyed the interview with you and would love to see some of your
skills in practise. The assignment is used to see if your a good match
for the team and the type of the work we do.

**Good luck!**

## Retrospective

This was an interesting assignment, I did not have any experience yet with Stenciljs so this was a cool challenge.
I time-boxed it to Â±6 hours max and tried to see what I could create in that time.

## Possible Improvements

- Some better E2E testing for the form/money-input. I started on E2E testing for the form component,
however some events/input stuff was not working as expected and I didn't want to get stuck on that.
- Some code cleanup for the flags used in money-input to show css transitions.
